        "Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all"
        "plants, fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced"
        "by humans. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands and other areas including the"
        "most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife.\n"
        "In more than 50 years of conservation, we have never seen wildlife crime on such a scale."
        "Wildlife crime is now the most urgent threat to three of the world's best-loved speciesâ€”elephants,"
        "rhinos and tigers.\n\n"
        "Illegal wildlife trade has exploded to meet increasing demand for elephant ivory, rhino horns,"
        "and tiger products, particularly in Asia. Controlled by dangerous crime syndicates, wildlife is "
        "trafficked much like drugs or weapons. Wildlife criminals often operate with impunity, making "
        "the trade a low-risk/high-profit business.\n\n"
        "Our application is to help the wildlife animals to get their rights and live in peace."
        "You just have to report anything wrong thing you see in the wildlife environment."
"Speak up on behalf of those on the frontlines being threatened by armed poachers so they are properly "
        "equipped, trained and compensated. The wildlife officer will look after your report and take action"
        "according to the laws.\n\n\n"
"YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE"
